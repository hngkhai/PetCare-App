# Chatbot Module for PetCare App
## developed by Hng Cherng Khai

This repository contains the chatbot module developed for the PetCare Appâ€”a group project where my primary responsibility was implementing the chatbot functionalities. The module is designed to assist users with app navigation and answer pet care-related queries through dynamic API integrations.

## Overview

The chatbot module comprises two core components:

- **GuideBot:**  
  Assists users with app navigation by extracting feature details from a PDF file and invoking the Gemini API.  
- **PetBuddy:**  
  Provides responses to pet care-related queries by integrating data from online sources using the Tavily API along with the Gemini API.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Mode Operation:**  
  - *GuideBot* for app guidance  
  - *PetBuddy* for pet care advice

- **API Integrations:**  
  - **Gemini API:** Generates responses from a PDF-based knowledge base and other dynamic content.  
  - **Tavily API:** Retrieves online information for pet care queries.

- **Input Validation:**  
  Verifies that user prompts are relevant (e.g., distinguishing between pet care questions and map location searches) and routes requests accordingly.

- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Provides fallback messages (e.g., "Error occurred. Please try again later.") when external APIs or backend services are unavailable.

### Data Flow Overview
1. **User Input:**  
   The user submits a query via the chatbot interface.
2. **Validation & Routing:**  
   The system checks if the query is for app guidance or pet care.
3. **API Invocation:**  
   - For GuideBot, the Gemini API is called to extract information from the PDF.
   - For PetBuddy, both the Tavily and Gemini APIs are invoked to generate a comprehensive answer.
4. **Response Delivery:**  
   The generated response is displayed in the chatbot interface.
5. **Error Scenarios:**  
   If any API is unreachable, a standard error message is returned.
